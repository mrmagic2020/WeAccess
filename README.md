## How to Use

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/mrmagic2020/WeAccess/latest).

2. Ensure that you have WeChat installed and ready in the `Applications` folder. Do NOT open it. You may use the provided copy of WeChat. It is directly downloaded from the [official website](https://mac.weixin.qq.com/?lang=en), and might not be up to date.

3. Run `MagicWeChat` by **right-clicking and selecting `Open`** to bypass Gatekeeper. Select `Open` when prompted.

4. Enter your password as required. This is necessary for force resigning the app after modification.

    > This workflow does NOT connect to the internet or attempt to store any data. You may disconnect the Internet or use a firewall to ensure this.

5. Allow up to 10 seconds after entering the password, as resigning the app may take some time.

6. Finally, WeChat will be renamed to “WC”. Right-click and open it to bypass Gatekeeper.

7. Use as usual. Note that you will not be able to update the app directly. If an update is desired, you will need to reinstall the app and repeat this process.
